## 🌟 Problem Statement

In India and many developing regions, rural people face significant challenges when traveling from cities to their remote villages:

- **Lack of route information**: No centralized place to find which bus goes where
- **Unmapped bus stops**: Rural bus stops aren't marked on Google Maps or popular apps  
- **Complex transfers**: Multiple bus changes required but transfer points are unclear
- **Scattered data**: RTC (Road Transport Corporation) information is fragmented and hard to access

## 💡 Solution

Our **Rural Bus Route Finder** provides a simple web application where users can:

1. **Input journey details**: Enter source city and destination village
2. **Get step-by-step directions**: Walk → Bus → Transfer → Bus → Walk
3. **View estimated times**: Total journey time and individual segment durations
4. **See visual routes**: Interactive map showing the complete journey path
5. **Plan transfers**: Clear information about where and how to change buses
